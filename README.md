# Overview
This program is able to read the XFF files from Shadow of the Colossus (PS2), extract their symbols, and merge them into a binary that can be loaded into Ghidra. 
Along with this, support for generating disassembly files for functions based on a split file to be compared against a recompilation in tools such as decomp.me.
Support for static recompilation for a native PC port, which was inspired by the recent N64 Recomp tool, is being developed in this tool as well.
